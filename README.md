## Getting Started
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. It is built using Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. The project leverages modern Flutter libraries and tools for state management, dependency injection, routing, and more.

## Key Features
- State Management: Uses BLoC and Cubit for predictable and scalable state management.
- Routing: Implements AutoRoute for declarative and type-safe navigation.
- Dependency Injection: Utilizes GetIt for service location and dependency injection.
- Dynamic Localization: Supports multi-language functionality with remote data source integration.
### Data Sources:
- Remote Data Source: Uses Dio for API communication.
- Local Data Source: Uses SharedPreferences for local storage.
- Testing: Includes basic unit tests for critical components.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following key dependencies:

- flutter_bloc: For state management with BLoC and Cubit.
- dio: For making HTTP requests to the remote data source.
- shared_preferences: For local storage.
- auto_route: For navigation and routing.
- get_it: For dependency injection.
- intl: For localization and internationalization.
- mocktail: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.
